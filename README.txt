I understand that I have a lot of files that are disorganized â€” I am currently working on cleaning them up.  At present, my goal is to get my Shiny App working online at ShinyApp.io.  I will work on resolving the inefficiencies with my files and the aesthetics and presentation of my Shiny App.  Right now, I need to get this working, and then I will be adding features and addressing the layout.

PROBLEM 1:  My Shiny App works locally without any problem.  I have also deployed the app and the user interface loads properly, but the app itself is crashing online and cannot seem to resolve this problem.  You can find my the app here:
