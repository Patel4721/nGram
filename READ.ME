I understand that I have a lot of files that are disorganized â€” I am currently working on cleaning them up.  At present, my goal is to get my Shiny App working online at ShinyApp.io.  I will work on resolving the inefficiencies with my files and the aesthetics and presentation of my Shiny App.  Right now, I need to get this working, and then I will be adding features and addressing the layout.

PROBLEM 1:  My Shiny App works locally without any problem.  I have also deployed the app and the user interface loads properly, but the functions that I rely on for the analysis are not found.  You can observe this problem online:  https://beperron.shinyapps.io/nGram/
